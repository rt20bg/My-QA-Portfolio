    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <article id="purpose-of-bug-documentation">
        <h3>1.1 Purpose of Bug Documentation</h3>
        <p>Bug documentation serves as a centralized record of all known issues within a project, helping teams track, manage, and resolve defects effectively. It ensures consistency in communication, provides historical insights, and supports informed decision-making in the development lifecycle.</p>
        <p>Well-maintained bug documentation minimizes misunderstandings between stakeholders and improves collaboration, ultimately leading to a higher quality software product.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="importance-of-bug-tracking">
        <h3>1.2 Importance of Bug Tracking in QA</h3>
        <p>Bug tracking is a critical aspect of Quality Assurance (QA) as it enables teams to identify, prioritize, and resolve defects in a systematic way. It supports transparency by keeping all stakeholders informed about the status of issues.</p>
        <p>Effective bug tracking helps improve the reliability and stability of the software, ensures better time management, and reduces costs associated with late-stage bug fixes or overlooked defects.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="target-audience">
        <h3>1.3 Target Audience</h3>
        <p>Bug documentation is designed to address the needs of various stakeholders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Gain insights into reported issues for efficient debugging and resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Testers:</strong> Track the lifecycle of reported bugs and validate fixes during testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Managers:</strong> Monitor project progress, identify recurring issues, and allocate resources accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>2. Bug Lifecycle</h2>
    <article id="overview-bug-lifecycle">
        <h3>2.1 Overview of Bug Lifecycle</h3>
        <p>The bug lifecycle refers to the journey of a bug from its discovery to its resolution and eventual closure. Understanding this lifecycle helps streamline the bug management process and ensures accountability at each stage.</p>
        <p>Typical stages in the bug lifecycle include reporting, reviewing, fixing, verifying, and closing the bug.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="bug-discovery-reporting">
        <h3>2.2 Bug Discovery and Reporting</h3>
        <p>Bug discovery occurs during testing or usage when deviations from expected behavior are observed. Testers or users document these findings in a bug report, providing details such as steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.</p>
        <p>Clear and detailed bug reporting is essential to facilitate quick identification and resolution by developers.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="bug-review-triage">
        <h3>2.3 Bug Review and Triage</h3>
        <p>During the triage phase, bugs are reviewed by the team to confirm their validity, prioritize them based on impact, and assign them to the appropriate developers. This stage helps prevent resource wastage by focusing on critical issues first.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="bug-fixing-resolution">
        <h3>2.4 Bug Fixing and Resolution</h3>
        <p>In this stage, developers work on resolving the bug by modifying the code, configurations, or other components. Once fixed, the resolution is documented in the bug tracking tool, along with the changes made.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="regression-testing-verification">
        <h3>2.5 Regression Testing and Verification</h3>
        <p>After the bug is fixed, QA teams perform regression testing to ensure that the fix does not introduce new issues in other parts of the application. Verification ensures the reported bug is indeed resolved as expected.</p>
    </article>
    <article id="bug-closure">
        <h3>2.6 Bug Closure</h3>
        <p>Once the fix is validated and regression tests are successful, the bug is marked as closed. Closure indicates that the issue is resolved, verified, and no longer affects the system.</p>
    </article>

<section id="bug-reporting">
    <h2>3. Bug Reporting</h2>
    <article id="what-is-bug-report">
        <h3>3.1 What is a Bug Report?</h3>
        <p>A bug report is a formal documentation of an issue or defect in software that causes it to deviate from expected behavior. Bug reports are used to communicate problems to the development team, enabling them to understand, reproduce, and resolve the issue efficiently.</p>
        <p>Bug reports are critical in the software development lifecycle, ensuring accountability, transparency, and a structured approach to fixing issues. A well-written bug report reduces back-and-forth communication and expedites the resolution process.</p>
